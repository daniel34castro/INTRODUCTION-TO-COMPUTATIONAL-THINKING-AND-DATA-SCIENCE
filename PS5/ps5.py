    The model for the graph Part B4 has a higher rÂ², which means that slope has less error for predicting
    the values of yearly tempeatures averaged by city.
    Therefore we can assert with more certainty the claim about the global warning.

    â Why do you think this is the case?
    The data points, that represented the averaged yearly temperatures, have less variance between years 
    making it easier for the model to minimize the distance from the slope to the data points.


    â How would we expect the results to differ if we used 3 different cities?
    What about 100 different cities?
    If we used only 3 cities the rÂ² would be significantly smaller, around 0.2 or 0.3.
    When we increased the number o cities the variability year-to-year of the temperature decreases
    because it the outliers get averaged out. Therefore the rÂ² increases.
