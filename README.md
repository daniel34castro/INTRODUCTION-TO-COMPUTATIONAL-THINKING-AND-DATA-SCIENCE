# INTRODUCTION-TO-COMPUTATIONAL-THINKING-AND-DATA-SCIENCE
All the documentation (including lectures and assignments) for the MIT course Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science is available online on:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/

This course is suitable for everyone who wants to understand the theoretical principles of how algorithms work and how they are applied to machine learning models. The course is very well structured which allows anyone to understand it, even without a computer science background. However, it is recommended some previous knowledge in Python. If you don't have that knowledge, you can obtain it in an other MIT course: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. 

Here you can find the solutions for this course assignments, PS1 to PS5. The assignments are very entertaining (in particular PS3 where you program an iRobot), the professors are outstanding, and lectures prepare you quite well for the assignments. I definitely recommend this course!
